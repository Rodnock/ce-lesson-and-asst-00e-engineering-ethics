### Section 1: General ethics

**1.3.1 What is the most generic definition of ethics that you can find in the encyclopedia? What are three (3) domains of ethics that are the most novel and striking to you?**

The most generic ethic definition for me is Virtue Ethics. When I think of ethics and being ethical I usually associate it is being moral, or "doing what is right". The most interesting ethics results that I found were Computer and Information Ethics, because it applies to the field that I want to go into, Internet Research Ethics, because I find the internet to be a very interesting place that has raised all kinds of issues, and Environmental Ethics, because it wasn't really something that I had thought about before.

**1.3.2 Where does Aristotle lay the burden of responsibility for ethical behavior?**

Aristotle says that a person is responsible for their own actions.
