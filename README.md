### Section 1: General ethics

**1.3.1 What is the most generic definition of ethics that you can find in the encyclopedia? What are three (3) domains of ethics that are the most novel and striking to you?**

The most generic ethic definition for me is Virtue Ethics. When I think of ethics and being ethical I usually associate it is being moral, or "doing what is right". The most interesting ethics results that I found were Computer and Information Ethics, because it applies to the field that I want to go into, Internet Research Ethics, because I find the internet to be a very interesting place that has raised all kinds of issues, and Environmental Ethics, because it wasn't really something that I had thought about before.

**1.3.2 Where does Aristotle lay the burden of responsibility for ethical behavior?**

Aristotle says that a person is responsible for their own actions.

### Section 2: Applied ethics

**2.3.1 If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?**

I tend to use a utilitarian approach to ethics. I believe that if all people were ethical, there would be no homelessness in the world. With the utilitarian approach, people would not lose their houses if they couldn't make the payment for whever reason. The morgage company/landlord would give them a break or work something out. And there would be enough housing for people in third world contries because people would build shelter for others, even if it was something basic.

**2.3.2 How would you embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself?**

### Section 3: Current ethics examples

**3.3.1 Read or skim the article Emerging Code of Ethics for Disaster Relief and identify the inequalities and conflicts that arise in this domain, and how they complicate ethical behavior.**

The main complication on researching disaster relief is that researchers flocking to disaster areas puts a strain on the area that was effected, as well as the survivors whom are trying to cope and recover from the disaster. However, the research that the scientists do in a disaster zone may save lives in the future. The article gave a example of this, citing the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. "This influx of foreign scientists angered and fatigued some locals; many declined researchers’ requests for interviews. The former governor of Aceh province, Indonesia, where more than 128,000 people died, described foreign researchers as “guerrillas applying hit-and-run tactics”. Yet research on tsunami propagation and people’s response to the event has led to improved warnings and emergency-response plans."

**3.3.2 The coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic has opened up a whole tsunami of ethical issues. Pick three (3) ethical issues specifically created by the pandemic and discuss them briefly.**

   1. How does society handle the spike in unemployment? Many workers that lost their jobs worked for small companies that also went under as a result of the pandemic. These poeple may struggle to find work again even when the pandemic lessens.
   
   2. What happens to people that can no longer pay for basic necessities? This one is related to the first one. If people that cannot pay for what they need are not tended for, there will be a large homeless population at the end of the pandemic when companies stop suspending rent or mortgage payments. These people may also be able to pay for their rent or mortgage, but may not have enough money left over to pay their bills.
   
   3. How do we find a balance between being locked inside and being safe? Research shows that social distancing works, but how do we handle those that refuse to follow the guidelines?
