### Section 1: General ethics

**1.3.1 What is the most generic definition of ethics that you can find in the encyclopedia? What are three (3) domains of ethics that are the most novel and striking to you?**

The most generic ethic definition for me is Virtue Ethics. When I think of ethics and being ethical I usually associate it is being moral, or "doing what is right". The most interesting ethics results that I found were Computer and Information Ethics, because it applies to the field that I want to go into, Internet Research Ethics, because I find the internet to be a very interesting place that has raised all kinds of issues, and Environmental Ethics, because it wasn't really something that I had thought about before.

**1.3.2 Where does Aristotle lay the burden of responsibility for ethical behavior?**

Aristotle says that a person is responsible for their own actions.

### Section 2: Applied ethics

**2.3.1 If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?**

I tend to use a utilitarian approach to ethics. I believe that if all people were ethical, there would be no homelessness in the world. With the utilitarian approach, people would not lose their houses if they couldn't make the payment for whever reason. The morgage company/landlord would give them a break or work something out. And there would be enough housing for people in third world contries because people would build shelter for others, even if it was something basic.

**2.3.2 How would you embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself?**

### Section 3: Current ethics examples

**3.3.1 Read or skim the article Emerging Code of Ethics for Disaster Relief and identify the inequalities and conflicts that arise in this domain, and how they complicate ethical behavior.**

The main complication on researching disaster relief is that researchers flocking to disaster areas puts a strain on the area that was effected, as well as the survivors whom are trying to cope and recover from the disaster. However, the research that the scientists do in a disaster zone may save lives in the future. The article gave a example of this, citing the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. "This influx of foreign scientists angered and fatigued some locals; many declined researchers’ requests for interviews. The former governor of Aceh province, Indonesia, where more than 128,000 people died, described foreign researchers as “guerrillas applying hit-and-run tactics”. Yet research on tsunami propagation and people’s response to the event has led to improved warnings and emergency-response plans."

**3.3.2 The coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic has opened up a whole tsunami of ethical issues. Pick three (3) ethical issues specifically created by the pandemic and discuss them briefly.**

   1. How does society handle the spike in unemployment? Many workers that lost their jobs worked for small companies that also went under as a result of the pandemic. These poeple may struggle to find work again even when the pandemic lessens.
   
   2. What happens to people that can no longer pay for basic necessities? This one is related to the first one. If people that cannot pay for what they need are not tended for, there will be a large homeless population at the end of the pandemic when companies stop suspending rent or mortgage payments. These people may also be able to pay for their rent or mortgage, but may not have enough money left over to pay their bills.
   
   3. How do we find a balance between being locked inside and being safe? Research shows that social distancing works, but how do we handle those that refuse to follow the guidelines?

### Section 4: Engineering ethics

**4.3.1 How does it mesh with your prior understanding of what computer engineering is about? Did you get a new perspective on an aspect that you hadn't considered up to now?

This code meshes well with my previous understanding of Computer Engineering. In any field, there is a code in while you have to follow, and engineering is no different. I will say that I wasn't expecting it to be so in depth, however.

**4.3.2 What does it address? At whom is it targetted? According to it, what is the most important element of ethical behavior when it comes to OSS? What OSS from Microsoft have we been using in our course?**

The Microsoft code of conduct addresses how everyone should act while using any Microsoft application, or participating in an open source community. The code doesn't specifically call out one behaviour more than others, but it says that everyone should be friendly and patient, be welcoming, be respectful, and understand disagreements and learn from them. We have been using Github as an OSS from Microsoft for this course.

**4.3.3 What is the main ethical aspect that is hinted at or stated in regards to data?**

Data ethics focuses on the problems that arise from the colection and analysis of data. What this data is used for can be good or bad, creating issues with discrimination.

**4.3.4 Why does a technical conference need its very own Code of Conduct? Use the contents to answer the question.**

A conference needs a code of conduct because there is a certain way that everyone is expected to act to make the conference a comfortable environment for everyone and to make sure that nobody feel like they cannot participate.

**4.3.5 What does Google appear to be concerned with? What kind of responsibility are they talking about?**

It sounds like they are worried about AI discriminating against people and not really doing much else.

**4.3.6 Tease apart the initially inconsistent, as it might appear at first, phrase "ethical hacking". That is, say a bit about "ethics" and "hacking" (as negatively construed), and then discuss how we can attach them together.**

Ethical hacking is typically used by organizations to find faults in their systems so that they can work to fix those faults and make their systems more secure so that non-ethical hackers have a much harder time getting access and harming the system or the information that is stored on that system. 

### Section 5: Codes of conduct

**5.3.1 What incentives can you build in the ethical code that would counteract the attractiveness of defection and, as a result, would mitigate the danger to the code?**

If everyone in the company complies to the code, the company will do better, and as such, there will be more money available to employees at review time.

**5.3.2.i Come up with the technical innovation at the heart of your reason to exist and your future product or service.**

A device implanted into a persons body that can detect cell irregularities and runaway in the human body, which would help detect and diagnose cancers.

**5.3.2.ii.a List at least 3 adverse effects (including but not limited to misuse) of the innovation, as well as some of the anticipatory actions and mechanisms you can embed in its deveopment, distribution, and operation to counteract these effects.**

1. Misuse: The device could be modified and used to collect information about the patients DNA and other personal information and the information could be sold.

2. The long term effects of the implant are unknown.

3. Detection and diagnosis can be inconsistant.

**5.3.2.ii.b Give an explicit definition of the fine line between the benefit and detriment of your innovation at two moments of innovation's lifetime: (a) immediately upon launch; and (b) after enough time has passed that it has been absorbed into everyday life.**

a. Any sort of implant can be dangerous. Plus, there would have to be lots of testing to make sure it is safe. The benefit would be early detection of cancer and other abnormal cells.

b. The benefit will have detected and diagnosed lots of cancer in the early stages. However, as mentioned above, long term effects are unknown, and they may start showing up as being deadly at some point.

**5.3.3 How are you going to ensure that you stay the course?**

Be sure that everyone follows the code of conduct and remembers the good that the device can do if used properly. 

**5.3.4 Define a Code of Ethics (aka Code of Conduct) for your organization, that will safeguard your original intentions and values while not stiflying innovation as your startup grows and matures. Your code should have at most 9 points.**

### Code of Conduct

We take our customers health and our employees responsibilities very seriously. All employees are expected to abidy by the following code.

1. The health of the customer comes first. In all we do, we are always thinking of ways to improve our device to make it the most safe and most reliable that it can be. Because the health and safety of our customers is paramount.

2. All people are equal. Act with integrity and professionalism no matter whom you are conversing with. All employees at the company want the same thing, to better mankind and make cancer a thing of the past.

3. Ensure that everything is done with the utmost quality and care. 

4. No conflicts of interest. Protect the companies information and assets.
